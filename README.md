# Global Energy Consumption Analysis (2000-2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global energy consumption trends from 2000 to 2024 using an open dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to transform raw energy data into structured insights through Excel-based data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The final deliverables include an Excel workbook with structured data and visualizations, as well as a summary deck outlining key findings and methodologies.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Global Energy Consumption (2000-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-energy-consumption-2000-2024)
- **Data Includes:**
  - Yearly energy consumption per country
  - Breakdown by energy source (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewables)
  - Regional comparisons and trends over time
  
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel** for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization
- **Pivot Tables** to aggregate data by country, energy source, and year
- **Conditional Formatting** for highlighting trends and anomalies
- **Charts & Graphs** (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps)

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and ensuring consistency in formatting
   - Standardizing numerical and date/time values
2. **Data Transformation**
   - Creating calculated fields (e.g., per capita energy usage)
   - Structuring the dataset for easy visualization
3. **Analysis & Insights**
   - Identifying global energy consumption trends
   - Comparing renewable vs. non-renewable energy usage
   - Highlighting country-wise energy consumption shifts
4. **Visualization**
   - Trend analysis using line charts
   - Regional energy distribution with bar and pie charts
   - Identifying peak consumption periods using heatmaps

## 📌 Key Findings
- **[Summarize main insights from the analysis, such as:]**
  - The global shift towards renewable energy
  - Countries with the highest/lowest energy consumption
  - Seasonal or economic influences on energy demand

## 📂 Deliverables
- 📁 `Global_Energy_Consumption_Analysis.xlsx` - Excel workbook with structured data, analysis, and visualizations
- 📑 `Summary_Presentation.pdf` - Concise presentation of the methodology, findings, and insights

## 📝 How to Use This Project
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.
2. Open the workbook and explore different sheets, including raw data, cleaned data, pivot tables, and visualizations.
3. Review the summary presentation for a high-level overview of key insights.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrating additional datasets (e.g., economic factors, climate data)
- Automating updates using Power Query
- Extending the analysis with Python-based statistical models
