#Global Energy Consumption Analysis (2000-2024)

Project Overview

This project analyzes global energy consumption trends from 2000 to 2024 using an open dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to transform raw energy data into structured insights through Excel-based data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The final deliverables include an Excel workbook with structured data and visualizations, as well as a summary deck outlining key findings and methodologies.

Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle - Global Energy Consumption (2000-2024)

Data Includes:

Yearly energy consumption per country

Breakdown by energy source (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewables)

Regional comparisons and trends over time

Tools Used

Excel for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization

Pivot Tables to aggregate data by country, energy source, and year

Conditional Formatting for highlighting trends and anomalies
